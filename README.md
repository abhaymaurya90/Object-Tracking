- ## Introduction

Object tracking for dimensional measurement is a valuable tool in various fields, including manufacturing, logistics, and quality control. This project aims to automate the process of measuring objects' dimensions by tracking their position and calculating their size in real-time.

## Features

- Accurate measurement of object dimensions (length, breadth, width, height)
- Support for various tracking algorithms
- Real-time processing of video feeds
- Visualization of tracking and measurement results
- Easy integration with other systems

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
